This is a development version of database and machinery which compares atomistic resolution
structures of biomolecules between classical molecular dynamics simulation models and experiments.

The <b>Data</b> folder contains a subfolder for each system. The <b>system subfolders</b> contain experimental 
NMR and scattering data.  The <b>system subfolders</b> contain also folders for available models. These folders
contain the <b>automatically generated quality reports which are called report.pdf</b>.
