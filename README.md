# MATCH

This is a development version of database and machinery which compares atomistic resolution
structures of biomolecules between classical molecular dynamics simulation models and experiments.

The '''Data''' folder contains a subfolder for each system. The '''system subfolders''' contain experimental 
NMR and scattering data.  The '''system subfolders''' contain also folders for available models. These folders
contain the '''automatically generated quality reports which are called report.pdf'''.
